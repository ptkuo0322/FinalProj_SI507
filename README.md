# This is the Final Project for SI507 Winter2021
This is a project related to python, SQL, web crawling, and user_interactive program


# High Level Description
This is a program that allows users to search for specific type of food (e.g., pizza, noodles,
etc) in a selected city from Yelp [Yelp Fusion API]. The search results would be
represented/stored in the CSV/JSON file and some plot forms, such as bar chart, or scatter chart
via plotly or matlibplot. The CSV/JSON file would have different information about the restaurant,
such as average rating, location, phone number, and etc. The plot forms would be demonstrated
based on the different standard, such as average rating, total review counts or so. After that, users
can decide to do the following things:
• see the related videos on the YouTube [YouTube API].
• have the restaurants marked on the static google map [Google Maps Static API].
• choose the most interested restaurant and show it on the interactive google map [Google
Maps URLs API].
